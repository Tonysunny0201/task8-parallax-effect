        <h2>Halloween</h2>
        <p>
            Halloween, celebrated annually on October 31st, is a holiday that has grown from ancient origins into a cultural phenomenon in many parts of the world. What began as a Celtic festival has evolved into a day filled with costumes, candy, and spooky fun. Hereâ€™s a deeper look into the history, traditions, and modern-day celebrations of Halloween.<br><br>

            <b>The Origins of Halloween :</b>
            The roots of Halloween trace back over 2,000 years to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced "sow-in"). The Celts, who lived in what is now Ireland, the United Kingdom, and northern France, celebrated their new year on November 1st. This day marked the end of summer and the harvest and the beginning of the dark, cold winter, a time often associated with human death. The Celts believed that on the night before the new year, the boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead became blurred. On the night of October 31st, they celebrated Samhain, when it was believed that the ghosts of the dead returned to earth.<br><br>
            During Samhain, people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off roaming spirits. The costumes often consisted of animal heads and skins, and the bonfires were meant to protect them from evil spirits. This tradition of dressing up and lighting fires has survived through the ages and remains a core part of Halloween festivities.<br><br>

            As Christianity spread, the holiday was blended with All Saints' Day, becoming All Hallows' Eve, and eventually Halloween. When immigrants, particularly the Irish, brought their traditions to America in the 19th century, Halloween transformed into the community-centered event we know today.<br><br>
            <b>Modern Halloween is marked by several key traditions:</b> <br>

            * Trick-or-Treating: Children dress up in costumes and go door-to-door collecting candy, a practice that originated from medieval European customs. <br>

            * Costumes and Parties: Dressing up in creative costumes is a central part of Halloween, with many people attending themed parties and events. <br>

            * Decorations and Haunted Houses: Homes are adorned with spooky decorations like jack-o'-lanterns, skeletons, and cobwebs, while haunted houses provide thrills and scares for visitors.<br><br>
            Though Halloween is most famously celebrated in the United States, its popularity has spread globally, with countries like Mexico, Japan, and the United Kingdom embracing the holiday in their own unique ways. Halloween is a time for creativity, community, and a touch of fright, making it a beloved holiday for people of all ages. Whether through costumes, candy, or haunted attractions, it continues to captivate and entertain around the world.
